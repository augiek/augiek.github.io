Augie's Github Page readme

Hello, and thanks for checking out my personal site. You shouldn't need to do anything except head over to augiek.github.io to view the site. I built the site in HTML, CSS, and JS, with help from Firebase to make the contact form functional. I watched a couple of Youtube videos to see how people formatted certain features, then made them my own by tinkering until it was passable. It's not perfect, but hopefully sufficient to let you know a little about me, a handful the technologies I've worked with, and a couple of examples of projects I've been a part of, either as a team or individually. 

There are links in the footer of the site to my LinkedIn and Github profiles--please connect with me there and let me know how I can be of service!

Thanks again and have a lovely day!
